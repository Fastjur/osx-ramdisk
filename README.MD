# OSX RamDisk
A simple shell script to
- Create a ramdisk
- Sync a ramdisk to non-volatile storage
- Unmount a ramdisk

Syncing should be done by periodically calling the script with the `sync` command, e.g. by use of crontab

## :warning::warning::warning: WARNING :warning::warning::warning:
This ramdisk script is heavily personalised for my personal setup.  
*IT IS NOT PLUG AND PLAY*, you should invest time into setting up the script for your computer.
